## 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Topography

GYMEZY is an enterprise fitness ecosystem connecting fitness centers (gyms, yoga studios, CrossFit boxes, combat academies) with consumers via on-demand sessions, multi-day passes, and memberships.

## 2. Actor Roles & Security Hierarchy (RBAC)

The system enforces strict multi-tenancy and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

| Role Key | System Name | Privileges & Scope | Permitted Interfaces |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | Platform Super Administrator | Full fleet visibility; approval/rejection of partner applications; financial audits; global system metrics. | `web-application/super-admin` |
| `GYM_OWNER` | Gym Partner Owner | Registration, profile editing, trainer & employee management, member attendance, check-in access, tier pricing, earnings analytics. | `web-application/gym-owner`, `mobile-application/gym-owner` |
| `STAFF` | Front Desk / Trainer | Limited gym console: member check-in verification, class attendance, personal trainer client logs. | `web-application/gym-owner`, `mobile-application/gym-owner` |
| `USER` | Member / Fitness Enthusiast | Search facilities, purchase flexible passes, book trainer sessions, generate dynamic QR check-in passes. | `mobile-application/user` |

---

## 3. Gym Partner Lifecycle State Machine

Every gym facility registered on GYMEZY progresses through a deterministic lifecycle state machine:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft : Partner Initiates Registration
    Draft --> Pending_Approval : Submits 5-Tab Application
    
    Pending_Approval --> In_Review : Admin Starts Inspection
    Pending_Approval --> Action_Required : Admin Requests Corrections
    Pending_Approval --> Rejected : Admin Denies Application
    Pending_Approval --> Approved : Admin Approves Application

    In_Review --> Action_Required : Missing/Invalid Docs
    In_Review --> Rejected : Verification Failed
    In_Review --> Approved : All Criteria Met

    Action_Required --> Pending_Approval : Partner Edits & Resubmits
    
    Approved --> Suspended : Policy Violation / Owner Inactive
    Suspended --> Approved : Compliance Restored
    
    Approved --> Terminated : Voluntary / Involuntary Closure
    Rejected --> [*]
    Terminated --> [*]
```

### State Machine Transition Rules

| Initial State | Event / Trigger | Target State | Permitted By | Business Logic & Side Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *Unregistered* | `POST /api/v1/gyms/register` | `Pending Approval` | Public / Guest | Generates `partnerId` (`GYM00001`), creates `User` (`role: GYM_OWNER`, `isVerified: false`), saves complete gym payload, sets `status: 'Pending Approval'`. |
| `Pending Approval` | `PATCH /api/v1/gyms/:id/status` (`In Review`) | `In Review` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Admin begins document inspection. Notifies owner via dashboard. |
| `Pending Approval` / `In Review` | `PATCH /api/v1/gyms/:id/status` (`Action Required`) | `Action Required` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Requires `adminFeedback` string. Sets `rejectionReason`/`adminFeedback`, leaves `isVerified: false`. Unlocks editing modal on Owner Web & Mobile. |
| `Pending Approval` / `In Review` | `PATCH /api/v1/gyms/:id/status` (`Rejected`) | `Rejected` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Sets rejection remarks. Application cannot operate. |
| `Pending Approval` / `In Review` | `PATCH /api/v1/gyms/:id/status` (`Approved`) | `Approved` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Sets `isVerified: true`, `status: 'Approved'`. Activates Owner account login, unlocks full Owner Dashboard & Mobile App. |
| `Action Required` | `PATCH /api/v1/gyms/:id/resubmit` | `Pending Approval` | `GYM_OWNER` / `SUPER_ADMIN` | Saves corrected form sections, clears previous blocker flag, timestamps `resubmittedAt`, moves back to Super Admin verification queue. |
| `Approved` | `PATCH /api/v1/gyms/:id/status` (`Suspended`) | `Suspended` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Temporarily delists facility from public discovery; freezes owner payout transfers. |

## 7. Cross-Platform State Management & Network Architecture

### 7.1 Web Client State Architecture (Redux Toolkit)

- **`authSlice`**: Stores `{ user, token, isAuthenticated, isLoading }`. Handles login, logout, and `/auth/me` user profile hydration.
- **`gymSlice`** (Super Admin): Stores live fleet array `gyms: []`, active filters (`tab`, `search`, `statusFilter`), selected gym detail modal state, and pagination. Initializes cleanly with **zero mock caching**.
- **Axios Client Interceptors**:
  - Request Interceptor: Automatically injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>` into outgoing HTTP headers.
  - Response Interceptor: Catches `401 Unauthorized` responses and dispatches automatic session logout and redirect to `/login`.

### 7.2 Mobile Client Network Architecture (React Native)

- **`apiService.js`**: Centrally managed base URL pointing to LAN host `http://<LOCAL_IP>:5001/api/v1` with configurable timeout.
- **`AuthContext.js`**: React Context providing `user`, `gym`, `token`, `login()`, `logout()`, and `refreshProfile()`.
- **Physical Device LAN Connectivity**: Express middleware server binds explicitly to `0.0.0.0:5001` allowing both emulator (`10.0.2.2`) and physical smartphones on the local Wi-Fi to communicate without proxy hurdles.

## 8. Production Error Handling, Logging & Security Safeguards

1. **Centralized Error Middleware**:
   All uncaught controller exceptions route through a standardized error handler returning uniform JSON responses:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "message": "Human readable error summary",
     "error": "Detailed error message in development mode"
   }
   ```
2. **SonarQube Quality Conformance**:
   - Cognitive complexity maintained within strict limits ($\le 15$).
   - Strict avoidance of hardcoded cryptographic credentials.
   - Comprehensive input validation on all routes using schema validators.
3. **Password Security**:
   Passwords hashed using `bcryptjs` with salt rounds $\ge 10$ and flagged with `select: false` in Mongoose queries to prevent accidental leakage in API serialization.
4. **CORS Whitelisting**:
   Strict origin matching for `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:5174`, and local network subnets for mobile clients.
